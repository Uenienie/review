0,"ive been using whitestrips for almost six years and i swear dearly by them.  people are always complimenting me on how white my teeth are, and its all thanks to the whitestrips i use once a year.  it says it lasts up to 18 months, but i find better results in doing this exactly every 12 months.  i cant recommend these enough."

1,"ive noticed a dramatic difference ever since i started using a waterpik. i have large gaps in between my teeth and always build starter faster than anyone else in my family. i usually have to get my teeth cleaning done every 36 months but now after 3 months of using this waterpik and closing at once, its been 3 months and i have no starter build up at all. this has a bigger tank than the scoreless one so you dont have to fill it in the middle of using it.my suggestion is to use the first half of the water tank to push out anything between your teeth, using regular loss, then the 2nd half of the tank to get what you missed, then brush, and rise. i only do this once at night before i go to bed and my teeth are starter free. of course you could do it multiple times a day, but who has time for that?my only complaint is it is very noisy!"
1,item was just what i wanted and what was described. will definitely order again.

0,"i have been using this product for about 30 days. i am 58, with naturally good skin. i have no wrinkles yet, but laugh lines and slightly tagging bowls were my constant reminder that i am aging. i am finding that a small amount goes a long way to tightening my skin and frightening my face. i am pleased with my results so far."

0,"i bought this in december (2 months ago) and so far so good. the reason the review is four stars and not five is that i havent gone the whole year yet without a respiratory infection.for several years now ive gotten at least one really nasty respiratory infection a year due to my own poor maintenance of my cap.  because of the ease of use of the clean 2 take off the mask, slide it into the basket of the clean, close the lid and walk away  i have have been diligent in making sure that the mask gets in there every morning. and so is hopefully getting clean.the speech that singers in the hose and mask after a cleaning is amazing, and not necessarily in a good way. when i go up for bed, i pull the mask out of the clean 2 and start running the air in hopes of blowing out some of the smell, and then go take care of my nighttime business.. this doesnt work very well as much of the speech remains  even after running the air on my cap for a half hour or so. it does lessen it to the point where i can actually slide the mask on to my face and go to sleep, but i can still smell it quite strongly.the clean 2 requires a small amount of assembly in the beginning since the manufacturer has allowed the user to decide which side you want the hose to enter the machine for cleaning. i found that to be very convenient. the directions were a little difficult to understand, but then again i am sometimes ""directional"" challenged. just one of those days, i guess.all in all, i am pretty please with the clean 2.once you set the clock and the time you want the cleaning to kick off, as long as the hose is in the machine, the cleaning will start on time. the first 10 minutes its kind of loud, but for the next two hours its about as quiet as quiet can be."
0,"works well, good quality. easy to brush my hair with this detailing hair brush.i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. all opinions expressed are mine."
1,i have tried a few natural deodorants and been disappointed.  this one is the best so far.  its still not as strong as the traditional deodorants with aluminum but a good contender.
0,"the hair doesnt move, it stay in place no matter how much the clip is holding, it doesnt slip. this is a must buy.!"
0,"the pure color crystal lip losses in pink light came quickly in the mail and were well wrapped.  the only thing was that the ad said they were full size, but i have purchased these before in the store, and they are not as large as the one i got at may.  but, regardless, they are an excellent buy for the price and i love the color.  they stay moist on your lips for hours and stay shiny!  i love this product, and would purchase them again."
0,i like this as a base when using very red lipstick.
1,"i tend to have headaches. i have tried several ice packs. sister spa is the best ice pack i have ever used. it seals well. my last ice pack from sister spa lasted almost 5 years until my cat poke a hole in it. other than that, the ice pack never leaked. it also never had any molding issues. i highly recommend this brand."
0,"these are amazing! my hair has never stayed in one place before but with these spirals, my hair stays and looks great with no ugly ponytail holder or bobby pins peaking out."
0,i have been looking around online and found these by accident. i thought they were super cute and i needed something for a good gag gift for friend. so i looked at some of the reviews and i decided i would give these a try and see if they were something i wanted for them. i ordered these using prime two day shipping and receive my product in two days. i opened up the box and i was very pleasant surprised to see that these glasses every wellmade and starting. they are not flimsy or cheap. i was very satisfied when i open them and they actually make very good small glasses for kids to play with like with tea and things. i would highly recommend this to anyone they are highquality and very wellmade and you will not be disappointed. i cant say enough good things about them for the price that you pay you really do get an amazing value. disclaimer i received this product free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review
